## Overview

{distilltools} is collection of tools to support the creation and
styling of content on websites created using the
[distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package in R.

It is in the very early stages of development. I am actively seeking
contributions - both ideas and code - to help build the package to be
broadly useful to a wide variety of `distill` users. The idea is for the
package to become a curated, collaborative, community-driven project. In
terms of relationship between packages, I hope in time that
`distilltools` can be for distill something like what
[xaringanExtra](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/) and
[xaringanthemer](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer/) are
for [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). Some of what I have
in mind may sit better within the distill package itself, and I will be
reaching out to the distill team about that.

#### Update (2022-05-29)

Development on `distilltools` has been on a bit of a hiatus recently,
but I will resume work on it. When I do, I want to ensure the package
also has the functionality to support websites created in R with
[Quarto](https://quarto.org), and so I may also rename the package.

An article on `distilltools`, and my intentions for it, is featured in
[The Future of Sata Science](http://datasciencebydesign.org/book)
anthology (written October 2021, published June 2022).

### Installation

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# install.packages("remotes")
# requires remotes >= 2.2
remotes::install_github("EllaKaye/distilltools")

# for remotes < 2.2
remotes::install_github("EllaKaye/distilltools", ref = "main")
```

### Functionality

There are currently five exported functions in `distilltools`.

#### Blogging functions

-   `create_post_from_template()`: this function works almost
    identically to `distill::create_post()`, but extends it with an
    added `path` argument that specifies an `.Rmd` file to use as a
    template for the post. This function can also be run interactively
    using the `Create post (from template)` RStudio addin. See
    `?create_post_from_template` and `?available_templates` for details
    on using your R Markdown templates with the addin.
-   `available_templates()`: lists a named vector of available R
    Markdown templates for new posts, talks, etc.
-   `create_talk()`: a wrapper around `distill::create_post()` that
    creates a post in the talk directory and includes buttons (made with
    `icon-link()`) for slides (both web and pdf), material, video and
    project. These can easily be edited in the resulting .Rmd file. This
    function was inspired by [Eric Ekholm’s blog
    post](https://www.ericekholm.com/posts/2021-04-02-personalizing-the-distill-template/).

#### Styling functions

-   `icon_link()`: creates the html for a link button with icon and
    text. Output of `icon_link` will need styling via the `icon-link`
    class to make it look like a button. For more details on this
    function, see [this blog
    post](https://www.jhelvy.com/posts/2021-03-25-customizing-distill-with-htmltools-and-css/#link-buttons-with-icons-text)
    from John Paul Helveston. For examples of styling the `icon-link`
    class, see [John Paul Helveston’s
    css](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.com/blob/master/css/jhelvy.css)
    and [Ella Kaye’s
    css](https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye-distill/blob/main/ek_theme.css).
-   `modify_default_highlighting()`: allows the user to swap the five
    colours used in {distill}’s default syntax highlighting scheme with
    five colours of their choice, and saves the resulting `.theme` file
    into the working directory.

### Contributing to {distilltools}

We’re actively seeking contributions!

-   Do you have a `distill` website? If so, what tools would you help
    you in the creation, upkeep and styling of your site? Let us know by
    with an [issue](https://github.com/EllaKaye/distilltools/issues).
-   Do you have functions that you’ve written for your `distill`
    workflow? If they help you, they’ll almost certainly be helpful to
    others to. Consider submitting (generalized) versions of them for
    inclusion in `distilltools`!

There are lots of other ways to support and contribute to {distilltools}. Please see the [contributing
guide](https://github.com/EllaKaye/distilltools/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md){target="_blank"} for more details.
