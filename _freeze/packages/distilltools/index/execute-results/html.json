I am actively seeking\ncontributions - both ideas and code - to help build the package to be\nbroadly useful to a wide variety of `distill` users. The idea is for the\npackage to become a curated, collaborative, community-driven project. In\nterms of relationship between packages, I hope in time that\n`distilltools` can be for distill something like what\n[xaringanExtra](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/) and\n[xaringanthemer](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer/) are\nfor [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). Some of what I have\nin mind may sit better within the distill package itself, and I will be\nreaching out to the distill team about that.\n\n#### Update (2022-05-29)\n\nDevelopment on `distilltools` has been on a bit of a hiatus recently,\nbut I will resume work on it. When I do, I want to ensure the package\nalso has the functionality to support websites created in R with\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org), and so I may also rename the package.\n\nAn article on `distilltools`, and my intentions for it, is featured in\n[The Future of Sata Science](http://datasciencebydesign.org/book)\nanthology (written October 2021, published June 2022).\n\n### Installation\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\n# requires remotes >= 2.2\nremotes::install_github(\"EllaKaye/distilltools\")\n\n# for remotes < 2.2\nremotes::install_github(\"EllaKaye/distilltools\", ref = \"main\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Functionality\n\nThere are currently five exported functions in `distilltools`.\n\n#### Blogging functions\n\n-   `create_post_from_template()`: this function works almost\n    identically to `distill::create_post()`, but extends it with an\n    added `path` argument that specifies an `.Rmd` file to use as a\n    template for the post. This function can also be run interactively\n    using the `Create post (from template)` RStudio addin. See\n    `?create_post_from_template` and `?available_templates` for details\n    on using your R Markdown templates with the addin.\n-   `available_templates()`: lists a named vector of available R\n    Markdown templates for new posts, talks, etc.\n-   `create_talk()`: a wrapper around `distill::create_post()` that\n    creates a post in the talk directory and includes buttons (made with\n    `icon-link()`) for slides (both web and pdf), material, video and\n    project. These can easily be edited in the resulting .Rmd file. This\n    function was inspired by [Eric Ekholm’s blog\n    post](https://www.ericekholm.com/posts/2021-04-02-personalizing-the-distill-template/).\n\n#### Styling functions\n\n-   `icon_link()`: creates the html for a link button with icon and\n    text. Output of `icon_link` will need styling via the `icon-link`\n    class to make it look like a button. For more details on this\n    function, see [this blog\n    post](https://www.jhelvy.com/posts/2021-03-25-customizing-distill-with-htmltools-and-css/#link-buttons-with-icons-text)\n    from John Paul Helveston. For examples of styling the `icon-link`\n    class, see [John Paul Helveston’s\n    css](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.com/blob/master/css/jhelvy.css)\n    and [Ella Kaye’s\n    css](https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye-distill/blob/main/ek_theme.css).\n-   `modify_default_highlighting()`: allows the user to swap the five\n    colours used in {distill}’s default syntax highlighting scheme with\n    five colours of their choice, and saves the resulting `.theme` file\n    into the working directory.\n\n### Contributing to {distilltools}\n\nWe’re actively seeking contributions!\n\n-   Do you have a `distill` website? If so, what tools would you help\n    you in the creation, upkeep and styling of your site? Let us know by\n    with an [issue](https://github.com/EllaKaye/distilltools/issues).\n-   Do you have functions that you’ve written for your `distill`\n    workflow? If they help you, they’ll almost certainly be helpful to\n    others to. Consider submitting (generalized) versions of them for\n    inclusion in `distilltools`!\n\nThere are lots of other ways to support and contribute to {distilltools}. Please see the [contributing\nguide](https://github.com/EllaKaye/distilltools/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md){target=\"_blank\"} for more details.\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nPlease note that the `distilltools` project is released with a [contributor code of conduct](https://github.com/EllaKaye/distilltools/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md){target=\"_blank\"}. By\ncontributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n\n",
